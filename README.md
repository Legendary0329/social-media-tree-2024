# social-media-network project #
this project allows user to input a list of names with specific structure and build a network tree with the names provided.

the STRUCTURE of the file SHOULD BE the following: 
  david lewis javier harry 
  davina catarina joe 
  sean 
  hugo leo dale jack peter
  alan elisa 

Each line in the file represents a person and the people they follow. Specifically, the first name on each line is a person in the network and any remaining names on the line are the people in the network whom they follow (you may assume no person follows themselves). therefore, in the example file: david follows lewis, javier and harry; davina follows catarina and joe; and so on.

to compile this set of code, download the zip. this file will contain some test text files and its answers and 4 different java files containing the program.

as this project is programmed in java, to compile type "javac *.java" in your terminal/shell and run the program by typing "java Analysis (your text file)" in your termianl.
for example: "java Analysis plain.txt". the output of different task will be printed on your terminal.
